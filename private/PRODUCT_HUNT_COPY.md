Hey Hunters! 👋

I'm Charles, maker of Schwarzy.

I built Schwarzy because I was tired of workout apps with big subscriptions or 1000 step flow to get started.

Plus, after dealing with shoulder and elbow injury, I realized what was missing: an app that tracks not just WHAT you lift, but HOW it felt. Your body knows when form is breaking down or when you're ready to level up. Most trackers ignore this completely.

**The Problem:**

Traditional workout apps have two major flaws:
1. They make you guess whether to add weight or not
2. They store more data than they need to and own it

Schwarzy introduces a pain-based progression system. After each set, you rate how it felt:

• **Flawless** - Perfect form, explosive reps → App suggests +5kg next session
• **Strong** - Solid reps, good control → Suggests +2.5kg
• **Compromised** - Form breaking down → Maintain current weight
• **Pain** - Risk of injury → Reduce 10% and rebuild

It's like having a coach who actually listens to your body instead of blindly following a program.

**Key Features:**

👻 **Ghost Sessions** - See your previous workout overlaid on your current one. Instantly compare sets, volume, and ratings to know if you're progressing.

📊 **Visual Progress Tracking** - Beautiful charts showing weight progression, volume trends, and form quality over time.

💪 **Built-in Form Cues** - Every exercise includes detailed form reminders so you never miss key technique points.

📱 **Program Support** - Import structured programs via JSON or create your own training splits. The app auto-rotates through program days.

🌙 **Mobile-First Design** - Dark mode, haptic feedback, wake lock (screen stays on), works fully offline as a PWA.

🔒 **Privacy-First** - All data stays on YOUR device. No cloud, no account, no tracking. Export/import whenever you want.


Schwarzy is 100% free and open source: https://github.com/funkycharlie69/schwarzy, so you're free to participate to improve it!

No premium tiers, no paywalls, no ads. Just a simple tool to help you lift smarter.

**I'd love your feedback on:**
- What other pain points do you have with current workout trackers?
- What features would make this indispensable for your training?
- Any major bugs or UX issues you spot?

I'll be here all day answering questions and taking notes. Would love to know if this is just a cool tool for me or if this helps other people train better.

Thanks for checking it out! 🏋️

### Extended First Comment (Alternative - More Detailed)

If you want a longer, more storytelling version (700-900 words), here's an expanded version:

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Charles, and I built Schwarzy because I almost ruined my shoulders trying to be consistent with progressive overload.

**The Breaking Point:**

Two years ago, I was religiously following the "add 2.5kg every week" advice from fitness influencers. My app dutifully reminded me to increase weight. My ego kept me going even when my form was deteriorating.

Then one day during overhead press, I felt something pop in my rotator cuff. Six months of physical therapy later, I realized the problem wasn't my work ethic—it was that every workout app treats your body like a spreadsheet.

They log numbers. They show charts going up and to the right. But they don't ask the most important question: **How did that actually feel?**

**The Realization:**

During rehab, my physical therapist kept asking: "Did that hurt? How was your form? Any compensation patterns?" These questions saved me from re-injury dozens of times.

I thought: why doesn't my workout app ask me these questions?

**What I Built:**

Schwarzy is a progressive workout tracker with a coaching brain. The core innovation is the **Iron Audit** system.

After every set, you honestly rate your form quality:
• **Flawless** - Explosive, perfect technique → +5kg suggested
• **Strong** - Solid execution, good control → +2.5kg suggested
• **Compromised** - Form breaking down, grinding reps → Maintain weight
• **Danger** - Compensation patterns, injury risk → Reduce 10%

The app learns from your ratings and automatically suggests weight adjustments. No guessing, no ego, just honest feedback loops.

**The Ghost in the Machine:**

When you start a workout, Schwarzy shows you a "ghost" of your previous session—your sets, weights, volume, and most importantly, how you rated it.

This instant comparison answers the question: "Am I actually getting stronger, or just doing the same thing over and over?"

If your last session was rated "Compromised" but you're feeling good today, you know you've recovered. If you were "Flawless" last time and "Danger" today, something's wrong—sleep, stress, or technique drift.

**Why It's Different:**

**vs Strong/Hevy:** They're great loggers, but they don't coach you. You decide when to progress.

**vs Fitbod:** AI workout generation is cool, but it can't feel your body. It doesn't know when you're compensating.

**vs Personal Trainers:** Schwarzy doesn't replace coaching, but it gives you 24/7 feedback between sessions.

**The Privacy Angle:**

I'm sick of apps that own your data. Schwarzy stores everything locally on your device using localStorage. No account, no cloud, no tracking pixels.

Want to switch devices? Export your data. Want to back it up? Export and save it anywhere. Want to delete everything? Clear your browser data.

Your training data is YOURS.

**What Else It Does:**

📊 **Progress Charts** - Weight progression, volume trends, form quality over time
💪 **Form Cues** - Built-in reminders for every exercise
📱 **Program Support** - Import/export structured programs via JSON
🌙 **Mobile PWA** - Install on iOS/Android, works offline, haptic feedback, wake lock
🎯 **Exercise Phases** - Tracks rehab → strength → hypertrophy progression

**Open Source:**

This is free forever: https://github.com/funkycharlie69/schwarzy

No premium tiers. No paywalls. Just a tool I needed, and maybe you do too.

**What's Next:**

Early testers want:
- Apple Watch support for easier logging
- More advanced analytics
- Custom exercise builder
- Community program library

But I want to hear from YOU:
- What's broken about current workout apps?
- What would make this a must-have tool?
- What features am I missing?

**A Request:**

Try it for one workout. Rate your sets honestly. See if the Iron Audit suggestions feel right.

If it helps you train smarter, share it. If it's missing something critical, tell me.

I'll be here all day answering questions, fixing bugs, and taking notes.

Let's build something that actually makes people stronger—and healthier.

Thanks for being here! 🏋️

P.S. - Schwarzy is named after Arnold Schwarzenegger. Because if you're going to name a lifting app, you might as well name it after the GOAT.
