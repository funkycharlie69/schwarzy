## Sample First Comment (Pin This)

After launching, post this as first comment to provide context:

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], maker of Schwarzy.

I built this because I was tired of workout apps that just log numbers without helping you improve. As someone who's dealt with training injuries, I needed something that could track not just WHAT I lifted, but HOW it felt.

**Why Schwarzy is different:**

The Iron Audit system learns from your form quality. Rate each set honestly (Flawless/Strong/Compromised/Danger) and the app suggests whether to increase weight, maintain, or back off. It's like having a coach who actually listens to your body.

Ghost Sessions let you see your previous workout overlaid on the current one - so you always know if you're progressing or need to adjust.

Everything stays on your device. No account, no cloud, no tracking. Just you and your gains.

**I'd love to hear:**
- What features would make this more useful for your training?
- What other pain points do you have with current workout trackers?

Thanks for checking it out! I'll be here all day to answer questions.
```

## Competitor Research

Know these apps and how Schwarzy differs:
- **Strong**: More features, paid, no intelligent suggestions
- **Hevy**: Social features, but basic progression tracking
- **Fitbod**: AI workout generation, but doesn't track pain/form
- **JEFIT**: Comprehensive but cluttered UI

**Schwarzy's edge:** Pain-based intelligent progression + clean mobile UX + privacy-first
